### A tiny complier and code simulater with C-Minus

Usage:

* make analyzer

* make TM

* ./analyzer

  then you will see three txts inthe folder
  
  * tmp.txt:deleted the comments

  * scanner.txt: the result of the scanner

  * Token_Tree.out: the result of parser

  * listing.txt: the generated system table

* ./tiny \<filename> 
  * after the code generator is done, you can run the compiled code with this

### TODO
